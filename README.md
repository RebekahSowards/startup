# startup
My startup project for BYU CS 260 (Web Programming)

Git's version control will track the changes I make, and GitHub will store those changes remotely.
I can make changes in my browser on GitHub or I can make changes in vscode, and conflicts may be introduced.

Good documentation is essential to a successful project.
Clear instructions make assignments easier to complete.

Assignments:
1. Discord
    - For this assignment I joined the class Discord and familiarized myself with the different channels and available reference materials in each.
2. Console
    - From this assignment I learned two new commands: top and less, which seem really useful. I'll have to look at their man pages to get more familiar with them.
    - I was reminded of the pwd command, which I always forget about.
3. GitHub
    - From this assignment I learned about viewing commits in vscode and GitHub.
    - I also learned about how to view diffs in vscode to effectively resolve merge conflicts.
