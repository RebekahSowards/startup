# startup
My startup project for BYU CS 260 (Web Programming)

Git's version control will track the changes I make, and GitHub will store those changes remotely.
I can make changes in my browser on GitHub or I can make changes in vscode, and conflicts may be introduced.

Good documentation is essential to a successful project.
Clear instructions make assignments easier to complete.
